## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a [decentralized](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/decentralization), distributed digital ledger that records [transactions](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/transaction) across many computers. Think of it as a shared, unchangeable record book. Instead of a single bank or company holding all the records, a blockchain distributes copies of the ledger to all participants in the network. This makes the data transparent and highly secure, as it's nearly impossible to alter a record without every participant agreeing to the change.

## What is blockchain in simple terms?

In its simplest form, a blockchain is a chain of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, and these [blocks](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/blocks) are securely linked together in chronological order. This chain is stored and maintained by a network of computers, not a single authority. Because the data is spread across so many computers, it is extremely difficult to hack or corrupt. This decentralized nature is the core of blockchain's security and transparency.

## What is blockchain technology?

Blockchain is a foundational technology, much like the internet itself. It allows for the creation of secure, decentralized systems. It's the engine behind [cryptocurrencies](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/cryptocurrency) like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend far beyond money. Blockchain technology is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. It uses [cryptographic](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/cryptography) principles to link blocks together, creating a permanent and [immutable](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/immutable) record of all transactions.

## How does blockchain work?

The process starts when a transaction is initiated. This transaction, along with others, is collected into a block. The block is then broadcast to the network of computers (nodes). These nodes validate the transactions and, once the block is approved, it is added to the blockchain. A unique cryptographic signature, called a [hash](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/hash), links this new block to the previous one, creating a secure chain. This hash is a critical element of its security, as any attempt to tamper with a block would change its hash, immediately breaking the chain and alerting the entire network.

## What is blockchain in cryptocurrency?

Blockchain is the underlying technology that enables cryptocurrencies to exist. Cryptocurrencies use blockchain as a public ledger to record every single transaction. This ledger is decentralized, meaning no single bank or government controls it. It is this decentralized and transparent nature that allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a third-party intermediary. When you send cryptocurrency, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see, ensuring its authenticity and security.

## What are the 4 types of blockchain?

There are four main types of blockchain, each with different levels of access and control.

1.  **Public blockchains:** These are open to anyone. Anyone can read, write, and participate in the consensus process. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most famous examples. They are fully decentralized.
2.  **Private blockchains:** These are managed by a single organization. The organization controls who can participate and validate transactions. They are not decentralized but can still be useful for internal applications and record-keeping within a single company.
3.  **Consortium blockchains:** These are governed by a group of organizations, not just one. A consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of participants. This type is often used in industries where multiple companies need to share information securely, like supply chain management.
4.  **Hybrid blockchains:** These combine elements of both public and private blockchains. They might use a public blockchain for some transparent transactions while keeping other, more sensitive data on a private chain.
