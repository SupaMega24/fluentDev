# The Token Whisperer's Workshop 

In the sprawling digital world of Cryptoverse, there are many [blockchains](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/blockchain). Each one is like its own city with its own currency. Bitcoin has bitcoin. Ethereum has ether. But what happens when people want to create *their own* digital assets?

To find the answer, we'll have to visit the ***Token Whisperer***.

## The workshop

The Token Whisperer runs a workshop on Ethereum Boulevard, the busiest street in Cryptoverse. Her shop is always humming with activity because she helps people create something special: **tokens**.

One day, a game developer named Alex walks in. 

> I'm building a game on Ethereum, Alex explains. Players need to collect magical crystals to unlock special abilities. Can you help me create them?

The Token Whisperer smiles. 

> Of course. You don't need to build your own blockchain for that. You can create tokens *on top of* Ethereum.

She pulls out a template, a [smart contract](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/smart-contract) that follows the [ERC-20 standard](https://www.cyfrin.io/glossary/erc-20?utm_source=fluentDev&utm_medium=glossary&utm_campaign=explainer&utm_content=token). 

> This is like a blueprint. It tells Ethereum how your crystals should work: who owns them, how they can be transferred, and how many exist.

## The creation

The Token Whisperer programs the smart contract:

- **Name:** Magic Crystal  
- **Symbol:** CRYS  
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000 crystals  
- **Rules:** Players can trade them, earn them, and spend them in the game

With a few clicks, she deploys the contract to the Ethereum blockchain. The crystals now exist as tokens (digital assets) that live on Ethereum's network but represent something unique to Alex's game.

> Your tokens use Ethereum's security and infrastructure, the Token Whisperer explains, but they have their own identity and purpose.

## Different use cases

As Alex leaves with their new tokens. Another customer, a nonprofit organizer named Jordan, enters.

> I want to create [DAO](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/dao) tokens so our community can vote on which projects to fund, Jordan says.

The Token Whisperer nods. 

> Same blockchain, different use case. Your tokens will represent voting power instead of game items.

She creates another smart contract, this time for [governance](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/governance) tokens. Same underlying technology, completely different purpose.

Outside the workshop, the street is full of tokens: concert tickets as [NFTs](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/nft), [stablecoins](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/stablecoin) pegged to dollars, loyalty points from coffee shops, and even shares in [decentralized](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/decentralization) companies. All of them living on established blockchains, each serving its own unique function.

The Token Whisperer watches them all flow by. 

> Tokens, she says to herself, are how we build entire economies on top of blockchains without having to build new blockchains every time.

# What are tokens?

While the **Token Whisperer's Workshop** makes for a good story, tokens are a fundamental building block of the [crypto](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/cryptocurrency) ecosystem. Let's explore what they actually are.

A **token** is a digital asset created on an existing blockchain through a smart contract. Unlike native cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain or Ether on Ethereum), tokens don't have their own blockchain. Instead, they live on top of established networks and follow specific standards that define how they work.

Think of it this way: if a blockchain is like a computer's operating system, tokens are like the apps that run on it. The blockchain provides the infrastructure (security, [consensus](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/consensus), and [transaction](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/transaction) processing) while tokens add functionality and represent various types of value.

Tokens can represent almost anything: currency, voting rights, ownership of digital art, loyalty points, access to services, shares in an organization, or in-game items. What they represent depends entirely on how their smart contract is programmed and what the community agrees they're worth.

> Tokens are digital assets that piggyback on existing blockchains. Instead of building an entirely new blockchain for every digital asset, developers can create tokens using smart contracts. The blockchain handles the security and record-keeping, while the token has its own unique purpose and rules.

## How do tokens work?

When someone creates a token, they're essentially deploying a smart contract that defines the token's rules: how many exist, who owns them, and how they can be transferred.

Most blockchains that support tokens have established **token standards**. These are templates that ensure tokens work consistently. On Ethereum, the most common standard is ERC-20, which defines a set of functions every token must have: checking balances, transferring tokens, and approving others to spend tokens on your behalf.

When you "own" tokens, what you really own is an entry in the smart contract's ledger. The contract keeps track of addresses and balances, similar to how a bank tracks account balances. When you transfer tokens to someone else, the smart contract updates its records, subtracting from your balance and adding to theirs.

Token transactions are recorded on the underlying blockchain, inheriting its security properties. If you create tokens on Ethereum, they benefit from Ethereum's decentralization and immutability. The blockchain doesn't care what your tokens represent. It just processes the transactions according to the smart contract's rules.

Different token standards serve different purposes. Here are some Ethereum Examples: 

* ERC-20 is for **fungible tokens** (where each unit is identical and interchangeable, like currency).   
* [ERC-721](https://www.cyfrin.io/glossary/erc-721?utm_source=fluentDev&utm_medium=glossary&utm_campaign=explainer&utm_content=token) is for **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, where each token is unique.   
* ERC-1155 allows both fungible and non-fungible tokens in the same contract, useful for games with both currencies and unique items.

> Tokens work through smart contracts that act like digital ledgers. The smart contract keeps track of who owns how many tokens and enforces the rules for transferring them. When you send tokens to someone, the smart contract updates its records on the blockchain. Token standards like ERC-20 ensure that all tokens on a blockchain work in compatible ways, so [wallets](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/wallet) and decentralized exchanges ([DEXs](https://fluentdev.vercel.app/glossary/dex)) can interact with them easily.
