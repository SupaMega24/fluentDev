            ],
            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "Public blockchains are permissionless and fully open. Private databases and invitation-only networks refer to private or consortium chains."

            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "Private blockchains offer restricted access and centralized governance. Public participation and full transparency are features of public blockchains."

            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "PBFT is used in permissioned networks to reach agreement despite faulty or malicious nodes. NFT creation and public validation are unrelated."

            ],
            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "Permissioned blockchains limit access to authorized users. Mining is typical of permissionless systems like Bitcoin."
