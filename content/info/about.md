fluentDev is an English learning platform built specifically for the Web3 world.
We help developers, builders, and professionals communicate with confidence through practical lessons that combine blockchain knowledge with advanced language skills.

Unlike traditional English courses, fluentDev is:

üéØ Web3-native ‚Äî every lesson is grounded in blockchain topics, tools, and real-world use cases

üìñ Story-driven ‚Äî with immersive narratives like **Shards of Consensus** to make learning memorable

üõ†Ô∏è Skill-focused ‚Äî built to help you present ideas, explain code, write proposals, and thrive in global teams

fluentDev was created by Charlie J, a Web3 educator, content writer, and business English communication coach.
After teaching English to global professionals for over nearly two decades and writing for top blockchain firms like Cyfrin, he saw a gap: talented developers and professionals struggling to explain their work in English. fluentDev is his answer.

> A space where language learning meets real technical fluency.

Whether you're preparing for a hackathon, applying for grants, or working on a DAO, fluentDev gives you the communication tools you need to succeed.
