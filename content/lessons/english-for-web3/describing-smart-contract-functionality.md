## 🧭 Lesson Overview

In Web3 and blockchain development, it’s important to describe what smart contracts do, and how they work, in a clear and professional way. This often means focusing on the action rather than the actor. Passive voice and relative clauses are essential tools for writing technical documentation, project updates, and audits in a precise and objective tone.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to use passive voice to describe smart contract actions in a neutral, professional tone, and apply relative clauses to give precise definitions and details about blockchain components. You  will also become more fluent in technical English and workplace discussions by practicing sentence structures commonly used in audits, documentation, and feature descriptions.
