## 🧭 Lesson Overview: Smart Contracts Explained

This lesson introduces the foundational concept of smart contracts: programs that run on blockchain networks to automatically enforce agreements. Designed for learners new to Web3, this module explains what makes a contract “smart,” how they execute across decentralized nodes, and why immutability, transparency, and trustless automation are core to their value.

You will explore key properties like atomicity, composability, gas constraints, and access control. The lesson demystifies how functions, state variables, and events shape smart contract behavior through practical Solidity examples. We’ll cover real-world use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and DAOs.

This lesson also outlines how smart contracts function on different blockchain platforms, introduces common programming languages (Solidity, Vyper, Rust, Move), and highlights typical security vulnerabilities like reentrancy. We’ll conclude by addressing smart contract limitations, such as a lack of native access to external data and complexity in upgrades.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a strong foundation in smart contract development, understanding what they are, how they work, what they enable, and the key risks to be aware of.
