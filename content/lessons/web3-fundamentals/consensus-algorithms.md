## üß≠ Lesson Overview: Blockchain Consensus Explained

This lesson dives into one of the most fundamental concepts in blockchain technology: consensus algorithms. You'll explore how decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum reach a shared agreement on a valid transaction history without a central authority.

You‚Äôll break down the two key pillars of a consensus mechanism:

**Sybil Resistance:** Learn how networks prevent fake identities from gaining control, through methods like Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Proof of Authority (PoA).

**Chain Selection:** Understand the rules that determine which version of a blockchain is accepted as the canonical one when conflicts arise.

Through real-world examples from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, you will compare these mechanisms in terms of their trade-offs, including energy use, decentralization, and scalability. By the end of this lesson, you will be equipped to evaluate different blockchain designs and apply your knowledge to broader Web3 applications.

## üìö Learning Steps: Your Path to Technical Fluency

1. **‚úÖ Master the Vocabulary:** Familiarize yourself with all essential blockchain terms so you can talk confidently about them.

2. **üìñ Go Hands-on:** Complete the reading assignment to reinforce your understanding of the core concepts.

3. **üìù Test Your Knowledge:** Take the comprehension quiz to solidify your learning and ensure you're ready for the next lesson.
