## 🧭 Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces the foundational concept of smart contracts, programs that run on blockchain networks and automatically enforce agreements without intermediaries. Designed for learners new to Web3, it explains what makes a contract “smart,” how these contracts execute deterministically across decentralized nodes, and why immutability, transparency, and trustless automation are core to their value.

You will explore key smart contract properties such as atomicity, composability, gas constraints, and access control. Through practical Solidity examples, the lesson demystifies how functions, state variables, events, and modifiers shape smart contract behavior. Real-world use cases are covered, including decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, and secure payment flows.

The lesson also outlines how smart contracts run on blockchain networks, introduces common programming languages (Solidity, Vyper, Rust, and Move), and highlights typical security vulnerabilities from reentrancy to input validation. It concludes by addressing smart contract limitations such as lack of native access to external data, gas constraints, upgrade complexity, and legal uncertainty.

By the end of the lesson, learners will understand what smart contracts are, how they work, what they enable, and what risks to watch out for. You will have a strong foundation for deeper technical or design-oriented learning in Web3 development.
