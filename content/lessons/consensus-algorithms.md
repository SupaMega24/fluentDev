## 🧭 Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces one of the most fundamental challenges in blockchain design: how decentralized networks agree on a shared history without a central authority. The concept at the center of this process is the consensus algorithm.

You’ll explore how different blockchains implement consensus using two key components:

- **Sybil Resistance:** Prevents fake identities from gaining control by imposing real-world costs, such as energy use (Proof of Work), locked assets (Proof of Stake), or identity verification (Proof of Authority).

- **Chain Selection Rule:** Determines which version of the blockchain is accepted as valid when forks or conflicts arise. Some follow the longest chain, others count validator votes or use cryptographic timestamps.

Through real-world examples from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, learners will compare consensus mechanisms in terms of:

- How blocks are proposed and confirmed

- How finality is achieved (probabilistic vs. deterministic)

- Trade-offs in energy use, decentralization, and scalability

**Key vocabulary terms introduced include:** staking, slashing, timestamp, epoch, deterministic, canonical, and throughput.

By the end of the lesson, learners will understand the high-level differences between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and hybrid models like Solana’s PoH + PoS. They will also build the foundational language to evaluate consensus designs critically and apply this knowledge to broader blockchain applications.
